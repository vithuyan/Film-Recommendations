Let's take a different approach to film recommendations:
create the same variables containing your potential film recommendations and then ask the user to rate their
 appreciation for

1. documentaries 2. dramas 3. comedies on a scale from one to five.

If they rate (documentaries four or higher),
  recommend the documentary.

If they rate (documentaries 3 or lower) but both (comedies and dramas 4 or higher,)
  recommend the dramedy.

If they rate only (dramas 4 or higher),
  recommend the drama.

If they rate just (comedies 4 or higher),
  recommend the comedy.

Otherwise, (else)
  recommend a good book.
